# Founded in 2009

Founded by Wilbert and Kristof. Their goal was to create a datacenter which was super power efficient yet cost effective.
Dacentec was Incubaid’s datacenter facility in North America. The facility was the one of the first energy-neutral datacenter in the world, powered by renewable energ.

Founded in 2009, Dacentec Inc. operates a 23,000 square foot purpose-built data center in Lenoir, North Carolina, and offers a comprehensive suite of dedicated hosting, co-location, and technology-neutral green cloud data center services. CentriLogic will integrate these services with its own hybrid hosting, managed services, and cloud computing solutions.

## Exit: 2013

Acquired by CentriLogic in 2013 as the company was expanding its datacenter footprint from Canada and the UK into North America.

The addition of this facility, which is located in the Southeast’s most active data center cluster, will provide CentriLogic with direct access to the numerous large organizations with enterprise-class workloads located throughout the region. CentriLogic will also utilize this facility to provide its existing customers with an additional U.S.-based cloud availability zone, along with geographically dispersed managed hosting, co-location, and disaster recovery solutions.

### Milestones

The 23,000 square-foot data center is SSAE 16 Type 2 compliant, has access to abundant power on Duke Energy’s low-cost power grid, and is designed with multiple layers of redundancy across all levels of infrastructure. Other assets acquired by CentriLogic in the acquisition include Dacentec Inc.’s staff, its existing office space, and current customer contracts.

### Today

Centrilogic is a leading regional provider of hosting services, has won a number of customer contracts and operates in a data center hub that has been validated by investments from companies like Facebook and Apple,” said Robert Offley, CentriLogic’s President and CEO. This acquisition gives us the immediate ability to offer our hybrid hosting solutions to companies located throughout the southeastern region of the United States, and fulfills the demand from current customers requiring data center space beyond our existing North American facilities in Western New York and Southern Ontario, Canada.
